        <h4>About Michael</h4>


        <div>
          <p>Michael graduated high school in 2009, completed a three-year Bachelor of Science degree in computer science at the University of Melbourne, then completed a two-year Masters of Engineering in electronic engineering. He then had a short-lived job at Erickson in software engineering before joining Atlassian as a graduate software engineer where he stayed for 3 years, working on various projects as the company grew from 1000 to 5000 employees. After that, he joined Google in San Francisco as a software engineer but left after a year and a half to take an infrastructure-focused job at Airbnb. He has been working there for approximately 3 years.</p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Kind of Work Done:</h2>
          <p>Michael is a project lead software engineer for AirBnB. He has said that there are two tracks' for people going into software developing can follow. One being the management track and the other being the individual track. As an individual contributor he is responsible for specific software engineering projects and leading those projects with other members of his team. Though he oversees projects and will write code himself, he does not need to do any of the roles that would normally come under a manager-like position.</p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Interactions With Others:</h2>
          <p>The role of software engineer involves you constantly working with other stakeholders. Members of his project team, members of other teams, making sure the technology they are making (the new infrastructure) meets the needs of the other teams and their work requirements. His role involves delegating work to other people, checking in with other engineers in the company, answering questions from other teams as to how to make their code work well with what they are working on or in charge of. He does not interact with people who are not engineers; the managers will interact with any outside groups that need information from them.</p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">How he Spends Most of his Time:</h2>
          <p>His job on a day-to-day basis is writing some code, reading lots of legacy code, understanding the legacy code that has been written before him and making sure that the projects he oversees are going to work with everything done beforehand while meeting the needs of the teams who will use what they create. He spends a lot of time talking to other engineers in the company from different departments to get information and advice to help understand the legacy work that has been done from the beginning of the company.</p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">The Challenges of his Work:</h2>
          <p>The most challenging aspect of his role is the amount of infrastructure his team supervises. They work on lots of different tools that are required by the entire company to operate. This means that they will get a lot of people depending on them, whether it be because they are not using the tools created correctly or that they have discovered bugs with the software that has been made. He found that it was hard to let some of the problems go as some requests will be a much higher priority, anything less important would have to be ignored due to the quantity of work to be done with their limited resources. Leaving some things for other groups to figure out how to fix on their own is difficult as he would like to help them all but there is not enough time for him to fix everything.</p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">What captures the essence of the IT Industry to Michael:</h2>
          <p>Agile iterative development is the most important aspect of the IT industry and making software. There are so many stakeholders operating on a singular piece of technology that the system that tech companies use to create software is vital to its operation. Using incremental development for all projects allows them the mobility to adapt to any changes, whether from the people wanting the work made to the changes made by the IT industry.</p>
