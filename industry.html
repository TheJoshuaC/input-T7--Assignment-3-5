          <p>There are a range of ideal jobs that the team have which are: software engineering, IT support and front-end developers. All these choices are very in demand careers in IT from employers and are increasing each year. The set of skills required for software engineering are: problem solving, programming, design and so on. For a career in software engineering, formal qualifications are required such as a Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor of Software Engineering or Bachelor of IT. As for IT support, the required skills that are necessary are: problem solving, up-to-date knowledge on technologies and in-depth knowledge on a specific field in support. An example of a specific field in support that one of our team members had as an ideal job would be network support. This could also require a Bachelor's degree in IT or Computer Science but is not necessary. Lastly, regarding the front-end developer job, the set of skills required for this would be: web development, strong proficiency in front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and an understanding of user-centred design. The IT specific skills in my required set ranks highly in terms of demand from employers. Most front-end developer work requires mostly technical skills such as web development, proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as experience with popular front-end frameworks such as React. Additionally, understanding of web performance optimisation and user experience design is also important for front-end developers. Overall, employers are looking for front-end developers who can effectively implement visually appealing and user-friendly designs, and who can write clean and maintainable code. The demand for general skills among front-end developers include problem solving, time management, and effective communication skills especially with team members at work or end users. Moreover, experience working as part of a team and the ability to work well under pressure are also highly valued by employers with other jobs. Furthermore, Strong analytical skills and critical thinking are also important for front-end developers, as they need to be able to understand and interpret user needs and requirements, and translate them into effective web designs. These are all important skills for front-end developers as they help create user-friendly and responsive designs and improve the website performance, but they are not in my required skill set as an IT consultant who mostly manages software licensing.</p>

<p>As an IT consultant who mostly manages software licensing, my required skill set is centred around understanding and managing software licenses, agreements, and compliance. However, based on my understanding, some of the highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not in my required skill set would be:</p>



<p>Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, or C#.

Experience with cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Knowledge of IT security best practices and experience with security tools and technologies.

These are all important skills in the IT field, but they are not related to managing software licenses, agreements and compliance which is my area of expertise as an IT consultant.</p>


<p>Three of the highest ranked general skills that are not in my required skill set would be:



Negotiation skills

Strong financial acumen and experience with budgeting and forecasting

These are all important skills in the IT field, but they are not related to managing software licenses, agreements and compliance which is my area of expertise as an IT consultant. Effective communication and negotiation skills are important for building and maintaining relationships with clients and vendors.</p>



<p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my ideal job has not changed as a front-end developer. I am relatively happy with the ideal job that I have chosen as this is something I have thought about while in my current career.   </p>

          <p>After reading Input[T7]’s ideal jobs the official job titles are Front-end and Back-end developers, ICT support technician, project manager and IT support. These jobs are always in demand, the job listings for project managers would always be higher as it’s a role that not everyone can fit and everyone business needs. However, the other ideal jobs listed can be fit into a role through a few years of self-study or official study whereas my ideal job requires years of experience. </p>
          <p>Required Skill Set:

          The required skills for most of the ideal jobs are coding front-end and back-end on python, HTML and other programming languages as well as being able to identify coding issues, holding relations with customers and shareholders and working on OS systems etc.</p>

          <p>General Skills:

          General skills that our ideal jobs would have are management skills, and excellent communication skills as we are all always working in groups which leads into teamwork. Problem solving skills, good attitude as well as being able to self-manage yourself so that even if you are working in a group no-one needs to help you step by step. Finally, being able to use technology for word processing or using apps like word, docs, excel or PowerPoint.</p>

          <p>When hiring, employers would have a high demand for programming language skills since everything is online and if you can’t put it online then there's no point in hiring said person if they don’t have them. Every employer looking for an employee must hire someone with this required general skill set since every IT worker has to communicate and work in a group making it one of the most important skills since everyone can learn coding but not everyone can learn better communication and organisation skills. The three main skills that are not required for my job would be a deep understanding of coding as my job is mostly management and people skills (However a basic understanding is needed), creativity as I’m just talking to other people about what they’d like on the project or if it's possible to do something and finally trouble shooting related to code. The highest ranked general skill sets that I do not need are direct management of the team members, the job is to simply push them in the right direction to do their work. PMs don’t help with the actual projects work as they are managing the actual project so that it is on time and in budget.



My opinion on my ideal job has not changed, as it’s something I would enjoy doing since as I enjoy being a mediator and managing projects.</p>

          <p>With the data provided, my ideal job would come under the occupation of Software Engineer.</p>
          <p>Regarding the skills in higher demand by employers, the careers an IT (Information Technology) professional undertake do change a lot. The skills required for many different jobs, even under the same title, have an ever-changing pool of technical knowledge that is important to that specific workplace and the role they are looking to fill. This means even if two jobs are for software engineers; they may require completely different skill sets to each other. The required skill set the job of software engineer needs ICT (Information and Communication Technology) wise are most of the top skills from number 1 downwards, the difficult decision there is that it would take a long time to become proficient in all the skills on the list. My general skills required are perfect, they will fit within all the high demand skills that are outside purely IT related knowledge.  </p>
          <p>The three highest IT related skill sets that are not requirements of my role as a software engineer are JAVA, SAP, and Graphic Design.</p>
          <p>The three highest skill sets that are not requirements of my role as a software engineer are business management, technical support, and customer service.</p>
          <p>Since going through the information presented in all the sources provided, as well as my own research, my opinion of my ideal job has changed. I did not plan what I would be aiming for when I reach the point of software engineer, however I believe I would love to be a solutions architect when I have enough experience to be in the role. The possibility of being the lead designer of a technical solution, leading teams into working on the solution and then creating something bigger than anything I could do on my own sounds like an exciting role. I would love to have the opportunity to express my creativity through solutions, and the role of solutions architect would be the ideal role for me. </p>
          <p>According to the Skills Priority List 2021, Software Engineer is in a current shortage with a strong future demand out of all. </p>
          <p>Labour market insights.gov has said by 2026 the job market for software programmers will grow by 27%, an increase of 42’200 jobs. </p>

        <div>
          <p>The Job titles for my groups ideal jobs are Front End Developer, Project Manager and IT Support. The most in demand job with the most amount of job postings (8,504 listings) is for Project Manager positions, followed by front end developers and then IT Support.  </p>
          <p>The set of skills sought after to be a front end developer are: Understanding HTML, CSS, CMS and experience working with JavaScript. The set of skills required for a project manager are experience managing digital projects and project management qualifications. The set of skills required to be a IT Support Officer include knowledge of Microsoft software (including Word, Excel, Windows etc.), basic understanding of networking (LAN, VLAN, TCP/IP), analytical and problem solving skills, good written and verbal communication skills and a prominent level of customer service.  </p>
          <p>In most of these jobs, IT skills are more important than general skills, except for the IT Support role which in my opinion requires an equal amount of importance. The highest ranked IT specific skill set that employers want, that are currently not in my skillset is experience working within the industry and in similar roles.  </p>
          <p>Since looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed as I know that my ideal job is a niche job and that there are less roles out there than the more general IT roles within the industry.  </p>

          <p>Looking at the group’s ideal jobs these are in high demand throughout the industry. The skills that are required for the jobs from the group are problem solving, multi-tasking, and communication skills. Those would be most important for the IT support area of the industry. For others it would be Java and other coding related skills.  </p>
          <p>The IT specific skills for my ideal job would have to be problem solving, working in a team and effective communication skills. These skills rank high in the list of demands from the employers. Three of the highest IT-specific skills that are not in the required skill set are business analysis, Microsoft windows and SAP. For the general highest ranked that are not in my required skill set are writing, research and quality assurance and control. Having looked at the Burning Glass data my opinion has not changed as gameplay engineer is still in a relative high demand.  </p>

        <div>
          <p> After looking over the ideal jobs of my team members, the most in demand jobs in order are front end developers, Helpdesk, support related roles, software engineers, and project and property operations managers. The set of skills required for these roles are first and foremost coding, alongside troubleshooting, the ability to provide tech support and customer service (if the support role deals with customers that is), and management skills. Coding and tech support will always be in high demand from employers whereas management roles tend to be less in demand due to less positions for said management needing to be filled in.



As for the It skills I do not have that are highly ranked, those would be programming as I am still learning python, Data analysis, and dev ops. For general skills that are highly ranked that I don’t have, they are data analysis, software development, and web development.

My opinion of my ideal job has not changed since looking at the data, as not only would my position remain to be in high demand, but its something I am passionate about, which is important to me </p>

          <p>My ideal job would come under the occupation of ICT Support Technician. Labourmarketinsights.gov has said that the role for ICT Support Technician will grow 17.4% by 2026 and have an employment rate of up to 94,200 is this occupation. Below is a list of skills required for this job role:</p>
          <p>General skills: good communication, Critical thinking, Determination, Ability to multitask, Team player, good attention to detail, good diagnostic skills, good work ethic, customer service, trust and responsibility, good written skills, good attitude.</p>
          <p>IT specific skills: Cyber security, general IT and networking, understanding of O/S servers and routers, Mobile device management, knowledge in windows updates and other RMM products, Clerical, Telecommunications.</p>
          <p>The three highest IT specific skills that I don’t acquire would be Security, Programming and the knowledge on Systems and Networks.</p> <p> The three highest general skills that I don’t acquire would be Clerical, Customer Service and interacting calmly with agitated customers.</p>
          <p>Currently I don’t obtain any of the IT skill sets required for an ICT Support Technician. Studying to obtain a bachelor’s degree and with further exposure to the IT industry I will be able to hone and obtain the required skills needed to fulfil this job role. The general skills I have wouldn’t be in the highest demand from employers, but they would still be in demand. Some of my general skills come from experience in the workforce industry, which some postgraduates may not have if all they have done is study. After looking at the Burning Glass data my opinion on my ideal job has not changed, since I like the broad amount of work related to the job. I think it’s a good career to get into and broaden my knowledge.
