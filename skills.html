        <h4><bold>Skills & Jobs</bold></h4>

          <p>Out of the many professions in the IT industry we looked at, the four that stand out as important to ensure the success for this project would be a UI artist/designer, Programmer, Security Consultant, and a Full Stack Developer. <br><br>
For the project we are working on, the product would be accessible through a webservice. For Dungeon Dice to be as user friendly as possible, we need to have the webpage be appealing, thus the need the need for a UI artist/designer. The skills they provide to the team are crucial as the user experience matters quite a lot for retention of users. They would need to work closely with the programmer to make sure the result works well with the vision of the entire project team.<br><br>
The expertise of a professional UI artist will have the knowledge and experience of previous projects, this will provide a valuable point of perspective that we can use to increase the engagement in the future. <br><br>
A Programmer is necessary in every situation as they are the bread and butter of an IT project. They are the key in transforming a project idea into a working project. Through their expertise in programming languages, they can use the best fit for our project goal to deliver a well thought out and functional project. The programmer would have to be adaptable to the needs of the project, preferably having experience with an agile methodology used in prior jobs. <br><br>
A Security Consultant is an integral part of the team as they can use their knowledge to protect not only the team/company's data but also the data of the users of the application. 
The project may rely on user data, such as log in information and that would pose a security risk that the consultant would be able to apply their expertise to prevent the theft of data from hackers and breaches. <br><br>
A Full Stack Developer would be a valuable member of the project creation process as they are the ones who will focus on integrating the Front-end and Back-end, ensuring that all parts of the project come together. <br><br>
Their knowledge of databases and programming languages will provide the tracks all sectors of the project will require to make this project possible. A Full Stack Developer needs to be able to communicate with everyone involved in the project so that the result is what the team had envisioned.<br><br>
Working closely with the Programmer and the Security Consultant so they can build a well-designed as well as secure database for both the project and the future users of Dungeon Dice.<br><br>
