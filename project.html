        <h4><bold>About Project Dungeon Dice</bold></h4>
        <p></p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Overview:</h2>
          <p>The project I am passionate about is to make a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) character sheet that functions as a dice roller and a stat tracker. This will allow people to go to our URL, enter in their details for their character, and then use the webpage as a hub for their character sheets and rolls. We will be able to make the background program that controls how the website works through Python, while it will be hosted on a website and designed through some HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS. </p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Motivation:</h2>
          <p>The reason we are motivated to create this idea into a reality is that a few members of the team play DnD and have a lot of fun doing so. All the online/app character sheets that exist on average, require payment, or do not offer a complete system that can do everything in one place. There are 9.5 million players of the 5th edition of DnD worldwide, and we feel like the community lacks a proper online character sheet that provides a service of storing weapon stats and character attributes. </p>
          <p>When Josh first started playing, he would have to ask constantly about what dice to roll, what stats to add to what, what he can and cannot do etc. With an easy-to-use website that can ease the learning curve while being useful well after the person is familiarized with the rules of the game, we could make a remarkably successful program for everyone. It is hard to focus on a roleplaying game when all you are thinking is “Oh god, I hope I am not asked what stats I got for this encounter. When would I ever need to use acrobatics?” </p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Description:</h2>
          <p>DnD character sheets consist of attributes as follows. Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. Those range from 1-20 any number above 10 that increases in increments of 2 gets a +1 added to their ability checks. Those that are below 10 decreases in increments of2 they get -1. For example, if strength is14 it gets a +2 to ability checks. If Dexterity is 8 it gets a –1 to ability checks. Most ability checks are rolled with some dice with 20 sides (D20) other dies are D12 D10 D8 D6 D4 D2 and D100. </p>
          <p>Base DnD statistics as listed above are the main sources of how the game is played by a certain character. With that said the base stats reflect other skills that rely on the base stats those being: Acrobatics (dex), Animal Handling(wis), Arcana(int), Athletics(str), insight(wis) and many more. As well as saving throws that profit from the modifiers of the base stats. Saving throws are in the same category as the base stats. If Strength is 20 then saving throw of strength gets a +5 to its roll. The products I want to design take all these numbers in and sort them into their relevant data types, in this case being numerical. Different weapon types and tools do several types of damage so my product would need to differentiate it. One weapon might scale with strength and another with dexterity as well as spell most of the time scale with your intelligence. With that said, you add your proficiency modifier to the roll plus your modifier for the type of weapon/spell used. Of course, for items such as weapons it would need to separate the data types between the item name and the damage to add the damage. Rolls to see if the attack hit is a separate roll thus needing to also add the needed modifiers to it. I would also have to consider the inspiration that other players might give the character and add that to the number. Inspiration being a number/roll of a certain die. To achieve this, I would have to design a character sheet that has separate roles for each data type and sort the weapons and spell type (str, dex, int, cha) into their respective categories. By doing so the user can simply attack and roll for both the attack and damage with their modifiers already added by the program. I am not certain if I want a mobile or a web-based program as the design would have to differ for both because of the screen space limit on mobile vs a computer monitor. </p>
          <p>f I were to go for a unique design, I could have an area in the middle that displays the rolls characters make. For example, the sheet would have 2 different modes Roll and Edit. In roll mode you can click on the type of roll you want to make. If you were making a strength saving throw you would just click on the strength saving throw and the dice would roll and add the necessary modifiers, then display the total outcome. For other dice I would have buttons that simply show the outcome of the roll without modifiers as most of the other dice do not get affected by them. For a damage roll the program would know what weapon the character is using and add the required modifiers to the roll. If the user needs to roll multiple of the same die the program would simply have an up or down counter to increase or decrease the number of dice. </p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Tools and technologies:</h2>
          <p>The tools and technology that would be required to develop and run this project are Python, the Adobe Creative Suite, and a webhost like GoDaddy. Python would be the main language for coding the mathematics behind the rolls and the addition of relevant data to operate as intended. As well as using the coding language to display the names of each data type (strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on) and assigning the weapon damage type. Python would be the easiest because it is the only programming language I know. In terms of design, we have team members who are experts in the realm of using Photoshop and the entire Adobe Creative Suite. They will be able to design the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and images needed to provide a vibrant and attention-grabbing experience when using the software. </p>
          <p>If we were to make it as a program accessible through a web address, it would be simpler to create and maintain. We can design a character sheet like the character sheets out there and add the necessary buttons that would perform the function that I need it to do. </p>
          <p>When starting this project, we will need to break up the creation of the program into steps and decide who will oversee those components. Each step will have a due by date and meetings leading up to the project's conclusion. For example, we will need to produce a program example that could demonstrate a single stat calculation from an input. </p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Skills Required:</h2>
          <p>The skills required for this program's development are wide. For the program's infrastructure, we will need members who know how to use Python. The coders will oversee creating the infrastructure of the program. For example, they will be tasked with designing and implementing a statistic calculator that can change based on the inputs a user has entered, ranging from character class to the types of items they are proficient in. As for the graphical side, we can use either Paint3D or Adobe Creative Suite. Photoshop will be excellent for the sprites needed to create the GUI of the webpage, an important and time-consuming task that will need to be done over time rather than from the get-go of the website running. </p>
          <p>The team can complete this project; the only concern would be the amount of time required to make it operate at a barebones level. Both a lot of code and art will be required to make all options needed to function for a user. We believe that the hardest part of this would be writing the code for the program due to the knowledge needed from dungeons and dragons to be transcribed into Python language. We have a few members on our team who understand the game, however that will still require constant communication between members who have learnt the rules and those less knowledgeable about DnD. </p>
          <h2 style="color: white;">Outcome:</h2>
          <p>This project can fill an existing market for people who are or want to start playing DnD through a system that will make it more accessible to play even for a novice. The original problem we faced was a lack of appropriate software that could meet specific requirements that would alleviate the difficulty of stat management for individuals. </p>
          <p>Through this project being designed and produced, we could lower the learning curve of Dungeons and Dragons for all. This would increase the number of people playing it while also having a highly trafficked website. Eventually, we would be able to introduce advertisements alongside the web page to pay for upkeep. </p>
