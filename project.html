          <h2 style="color: white;">Topic:</h2>
          <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a game that in recent years has increasingly gained in popularity due to the rising demand in gaming entertainment across the globe. Also known as D&D, the tabletop role-playing game was first published in 1974 as a highly player driven game that can adapt to the imagination of the players. A crucial tool required for each player is their character sheet, either a physical or digital copy of their character statistics that cover everything from who they are, what they can do, what items they have and optional information that allows the players to flesh out their characters. <br><br>
              The character sheet determines how a player can interact with the story and world made by a person called a “Dungeon Master.” Information such as their character's ability score are required when determining the outcome of an action taken. For example, the Dungeon Master could tell your party about a sheer cliff face that had your goal at the top, then ask what you would like to do to pass this obstacle. Your individual statistics will either increase or decrease your chance to do an action like attempting to climb the cliff as an addition to the dice numbers rolled. <br><br>
              Team input(T7) have been working tirelessly on a project we have called “Dungeon Dice”. Our objective is to design and produce a piece of software that assists players in creating new characters through a clear, easy to use system that removes the knowledge barrier to playing Dungeons and Dragons. We will achieve this through software that offers several choices that can fit to what the user needs. Firstly, it will create new character profiles that can be saved for later use by both the program and the user. It will also be able to redo the statistics for a character, assign items based on class and race choices that are unique to the type of character created and a dice roll generator. </p>
          
          <h2 style="color: white;">Motivation:</h2>
          <p>Team input(T7) believes that for fresh players of D&D, the creation of a character sheet can be not just daunting, but a deterrent that stops many interested parties in starting their adventure into the world of roleplaying games. Current trends within roleplaying games have been rapidly increasing since 2012, only dropping during the COVID19 Pandemic, then outdoing itself when the world was coming out the pandemic. The attention given from internet users gives D&D a large amount of advertisement and raises the interest for inexperienced people to want to try and play the game themselves. If we ease the entry knowledge required to play the game, we can increase the player base drastically. The work being done by our team shows potential employers that we understand that ease of use when it comes to anything unfamiliar is a significant factor in whether they will pursue their interest further. The project also demonstrates our knowledge and skills in programming, media production, documentation, and collaboration within a group setting. </p>          
          
          <h2 style="color: white;">Landscape:</h2>
          <p>There are a few similar projects available that offer a character creation system. Some of these include D&D Beyond, Dungeon Masters Vault, the Reroll App and Charactercreator.org. Our project differs from the competition by offering software that runs from your computer, easy to use and is free. Members of our project have attempted to use these alternatives and have found the UI (User Interface) discouraging for inexperienced players due to the overwhelming amount of information given and asked for by the user. Our project is a much simpler and easy to follow system that gives the user all the information required while not overloading them with the amount of information they have access to. We can do this by separating the components of a character sheet, and then asking the user for their input incrementally.</p>
          
     <h2 style="color: white;">Aims:</h2>
          <p>We're creating a computer program that can make characters for a game called Dungeons and Dragons based on input supplied by the user. These characters will have information such as equipped armour, stats (like strength and intelligence), equipped weapons, and other important details. The program can save these characters in a simple text file (which means it can be saved and used later). This text file can be read by other computer programs (like future games) so the character information can be used again, or modified</p>
          
                    
     <h2 style="color: white;">Scope & Limits:</h2>
          <p>Our goal when developing our project will be the use of a D & D tool that allows the users whether they be teenagers, young adults, or adults to not have to worry about the calculations and any not have to forget any given scenarios implemented into the game by the “game master.” We would also like it so that it is new player friendly as one of the many questions newer players ask are “can I do this?” which we would like to lower. The tool that we will be creating will simply be a quality-of-life improvement for all types of players, being able to make calculations on the go, while also documenting the game for any forgotten limitations implemented by the “game master.”   <br><br>
As of now we do not believe that there are any limitations for our project in the sense that what we are aiming for is very accomplishable as well as being very financially friendly. Thus, overall, the main goal we would like to accomplish is the creation of a tool that simply calculates and documents the game for both older players so that they can simply play the game at a faster pace and newer players, so they do not get confused and/or discouraged when learning D & D.
