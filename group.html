        <h4><bold>Group Processes</bold></h4>

          <p>Input T7 worked well together on assignment 2. As a group, we were able to effectively communicate with each other and delegate tasks based on our individual strengths. We had a weekly video call to discuss progress, assign tasks to each other and give each other feedback on our work. When it came to any obstacle, we were able to discuss the problems as a group and decide our next course of action. This was assisted using a google form which would give all team members the opportunity to vote on what they thought would be the best choice to make. <br><br>
In the upcoming Assignment 3, there is room for improvement. To work better on the upcoming assignment, we recognized that we need to establish clear goals and expectations for all team members from the beginning of the project. For assignment 3, we created a project plan and delegated tasks to each team member, with more stringent deadlines. Another way in which we can improve is by setting aside time near the end of the project, for us to go over the entire document, and make sure that it is concise throughout. 
</p> 
          
          <h4><bold>Roles</bold></h4>

          <p>The group Input [T7] has a varying group in experience and skill sets. On one hand we have someone who loves to code, a natural team leader, a few people skilled in website coding, and a few other skills with a very wide ethnic background. <br><br>
Team Member 1: Leads the teamâ€™s projects and helps organize the files that need to be implemented if needed. <br>
Team Member 2: Very committed to coding and loves to do so. <br>
Team Member 3 - 4: Both members are competent in website coding.<br> 
Team Member 5: Researches and reports on whatever the team needs. <br>
Team Member 6: Researches and reports on whatever the team needs. <br>
Team Member 7: Researches and reports on whatever the team needs. <br><br>
Overall: Everyone is friendly and open to talking to each other for anything we separately need. We all trust each other to get our section of the work done while also being open to learning about each other. <br>
The previous project Input [T7] collaborated on together was a success with all of us getting our work done while also being able to utilize all our skills in an open matter with no issues of team cohesion being found (personality indifferences etc.).
