My primary interest is in tech support, as providing tech help to people who need it, and fixing computers myself is one of my primary passions in life. I also have several degrees in IT including a Cert IV in cybersecurity, and a Cert IV in Information technology. I am currently in this course so that I can become eligible for a bachelor in IT. I am looking forward to working with this group so that I can pass this course!</p>

                          <p>Hello everyone, my name is Joshua Christiansen (Student ID: s3988682) and here’s a little bit of information about me. I am 25 years old, live with my Fiancee, three dogs and cat in Murrumbeena, Melbourne. I am currently a full time carer, in the past my work/study backgrounds include working as a BMW mechanic, insurance specialist for all Suncorp companies, running gaming rooms at night in pubs around Melbourne and I operate a small handyman business which covers everything from computers to carpentry. I would label myself as a jack of all trades, work that requires creativity is fulfilling in the sense that I get to solve a problem that doesn’t have a simple solution. My hobbies include exercising, creating/fixing pieces of furniture, clothing or jewellery and reading a lot of books about psychology, sociology and philosophy. IT has been a part of my life from a very young age, I spent a lot of my childhood playing with computers and discovering what I can do with them. This inspired me to learn about how they work, how to fix them and what is possible with an off-beige coloured “heater”. Ever since I was 5 years old I loved playing games, learning about new topics through the internet and being scared of videos involving “relaxing car drives”. </p>

Growing up I played several sports, mainly soccer, which I had done for 10 years. My dream was to play professional soccer, but my mind changed when I got my apprenticeship. I finished year 12 as well as getting an apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic, after qualifying I decided to join the Army in 2015 as a Mechanic. My career in the Army lasted for 7 years and now I have decided to try and make a career change.Growing up I’ve enjoyed playing sports, gym and gaming, over the years my interest in gaming has grown. I have had many mates that aren’t part of the IT industry but are very knowledgeable when it comes to technology and that is one of the reasons, I want to pursue a career in IT. I currently have little to no IT experience, but I am willing to learn all I can.</p>

I’m a super curious individual who loves seeing how things work and how I can hack things to make them work together.   </p>
