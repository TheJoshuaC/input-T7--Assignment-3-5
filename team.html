                          <p>My name is Amani Zafirah Mohammad Anwar from the group input(T7) and am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some major hobbies that I am involved in are hiking, playing online games, and travelling. As a student pursuing a Bachelor of IT, I have gained over a year of professional experience in the field. My background includes serving as a contractor for the ATO as an IT technician and working in a similar role at the University of Melbourne. In my current position as an IT consultant, I am a member of the software licensing team responsible for procuring software for staff at the university. This involves managing quotes from vendors and coordinating the purchase of software through the university. In addition to my work experience, I am proficient in both Malay and English and have gained technical proficiency through my basic knowledge of hardware and software. Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking, playing online games, and traveling.</p>

My primary interest is in tech support, as providing tech help to people who need it, and fixing computers myself is one of my primary passions in life. I also have several degrees in IT including a Cert IV in cybersecurity, and a Cert IV in Information technology. I am currently in this course so that I can become eligible for a bachelor in IT. I am looking forward to working with this group so that I can pass this course!</p>

                          <p>Hello everyone, my name is Joshua Christiansen (Student ID: s3988682) and here’s a little bit of information about me. I am 25 years old, live with my Fiancee, three dogs and cat in Murrumbeena, Melbourne. I am currently a full time carer, in the past my work/study backgrounds include working as a BMW mechanic, insurance specialist for all Suncorp companies, running gaming rooms at night in pubs around Melbourne and I operate a small handyman business which covers everything from computers to carpentry. I would label myself as a jack of all trades, work that requires creativity is fulfilling in the sense that I get to solve a problem that doesn’t have a simple solution. My hobbies include exercising, creating/fixing pieces of furniture, clothing or jewellery and reading a lot of books about psychology, sociology and philosophy. IT has been a part of my life from a very young age, I spent a lot of my childhood playing with computers and discovering what I can do with them. This inspired me to learn about how they work, how to fix them and what is possible with an off-beige coloured “heater”. Ever since I was 5 years old I loved playing games, learning about new topics through the internet and being scared of videos involving “relaxing car drives”. </p>

Growing up I played several sports, mainly soccer, which I had done for 10 years. My dream was to play professional soccer, but my mind changed when I got my apprenticeship. I finished year 12 as well as getting an apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic, after qualifying I decided to join the Army in 2015 as a Mechanic. My career in the Army lasted for 7 years and now I have decided to try and make a career change.Growing up I’ve enjoyed playing sports, gym and gaming, over the years my interest in gaming has grown. I have had many mates that aren’t part of the IT industry but are very knowledgeable when it comes to technology and that is one of the reasons, I want to pursue a career in IT. I currently have little to no IT experience, but I am willing to learn all I can.</p>

  <!-- Ideal Jobs Differences -->


  <section class="simple-cta">

        <h4>Ideal Job Comparison</h4>


        <div>
          <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Amani</h4>
          <p>My ideal job as a front-end developer is similar to one person in this team while everyone else are looking into jobs either in support or software engineering. The plan is to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience for the front-end developer position is to first complete a degree in Information Technology at RMIT it requires formal qualifications. Secondly, to gain 2 years of experience in front-end developing by engaging in internships in the field. On top of this, being proficient in front-end languages and focusing on HTML, CSS and Javascript because these are the technical skills essential to the job description.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">James</h4>
          <p>The role i selected is to perform level 3 support for people reporting technical issues. In order to qualify for this role, I’d need more Technical experience in Network and Support functions, experience providing business, server and network IT support, and 5 years working as a technician. I meet the rest of the qualifications. In order to obtain what I’m missing, I’d need more study and to actually get a starting helpdesk role as that would provide me the experience I need, (especially as that essentially just be a less advanced version of the job I posted)</p>
          <br>


          <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Joshua</h4>
          <p>After reading through my groups ideal roles I am seeing that we are mostly heading in different directions within the IT sector. I am looking for a role that requires me to come up with creative solutions to IT problems through software engineering and implement them within a large organisation. The differences are varied between members and their chosen jobs. Broadly speaking, only a few people are aiming for work at specific businesses. This is probably due to the influence these companies have made on our day-to-day lives.</p>
          <br>


          <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Khaled</h4>
          <p>Most of the ideal jobs in Input [T7] are related to programming front-end, back-end relating to applications and games. Some are on the physical end in regard to systems. The ideal job that I had put down was a Project/Engagement Manager which is fundamentally different in regards to my group which would require me to hold relations of customers and shareholders gathering their thoughts. Whereas my group’s ideal jobs are to program/code or install and maintain systems with fellow workers. </p>
          <br>


          <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Luke</h4>
          <p>Looking at the group’s ideal jobs everyone seems to have a clear idea of where they want to be in the future. For myself though I don’t have much exposure to IT, so I am still indecisive of what my ideal job would be. For now, I choose IT support because it has a broad of experience involved in the job. When it comes to comparison to the other jobs some are going down the path of programming/coding or looking to get into a Managers role, while mine will be more focused on maintenance and support.</p>

          <p>The ideal jobs that my team are interested in range from IT Support to Software Developers and Engineers. In comparison, I am more interested in managing and directing a team on their day to day activities. My ideal role as Property Operations Manager could potentially interact and oversee all my teams ideal jobs. </p>
