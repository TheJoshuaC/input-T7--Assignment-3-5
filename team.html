                          <p>My name is Amani Zafirah Mohammad Anwar from the group input(T7) and am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some major hobbies that I am involved in are hiking, playing online games, and travelling. As a student pursuing a Bachelor of IT, I have gained over a year of professional experience in the field. My background includes serving as a contractor for the ATO as an IT technician and working in a similar role at the University of Melbourne. In my current position as an IT consultant, I am a member of the software licensing team responsible for procuring software for staff at the university. This involves managing quotes from vendors and coordinating the purchase of software through the university. In addition to my work experience, I am proficient in both Malay and English and have gained technical proficiency through my basic knowledge of hardware and software. Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking, playing online games, and traveling.</p>

My primary interest is in tech support, as providing tech help to people who need it, and fixing computers myself is one of my primary passions in life. I also have several degrees in IT including a Cert IV in cybersecurity, and a Cert IV in Information technology. I am currently in this course so that I can become eligible for a bachelor in IT. I am looking forward to working with this group so that I can pass this course!</p>

                          <p>Hello everyone, my name is Joshua Christiansen (Student ID: s3988682) and here’s a little bit of information about me. I am 25 years old, live with my Fiancee, three dogs and cat in Murrumbeena, Melbourne. I am currently a full time carer, in the past my work/study backgrounds include working as a BMW mechanic, insurance specialist for all Suncorp companies, running gaming rooms at night in pubs around Melbourne and I operate a small handyman business which covers everything from computers to carpentry. I would label myself as a jack of all trades, work that requires creativity is fulfilling in the sense that I get to solve a problem that doesn’t have a simple solution. My hobbies include exercising, creating/fixing pieces of furniture, clothing or jewellery and reading a lot of books about psychology, sociology and philosophy. IT has been a part of my life from a very young age, I spent a lot of my childhood playing with computers and discovering what I can do with them. This inspired me to learn about how they work, how to fix them and what is possible with an off-beige coloured “heater”. Ever since I was 5 years old I loved playing games, learning about new topics through the internet and being scared of videos involving “relaxing car drives”. </p>

My Experience in IT has just started with me doing a course in Cyber Security and one course of python programming prior to this course. I’m happy to be a part of team “Input [T7]”.</p>

Growing up I played several sports, mainly soccer, which I had done for 10 years. My dream was to play professional soccer, but my mind changed when I got my apprenticeship. I finished year 12 as well as getting an apprenticeship as a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic, after qualifying I decided to join the Army in 2015 as a Mechanic. My career in the Army lasted for 7 years and now I have decided to try and make a career change.Growing up I’ve enjoyed playing sports, gym and gaming, over the years my interest in gaming has grown. I have had many mates that aren’t part of the IT industry but are very knowledgeable when it comes to technology and that is one of the reasons, I want to pursue a career in IT. I currently have little to no IT experience, but I am willing to learn all I can.</p>

I am 26 years old and my hobbies are both photography and technology; two things that I have turned into a job over the past few years. I work for myself directing my entertainment and digital agency businesses. My passion for IT started when I was quite young, around when dial up was still a thing. Since then, my passion has grown and evolved. Over the past 6 years I have been studying part time and YouTubing different IT projects to complete on the side. I’m a super curious individual who loves seeing how things work and how I can hack things to make them work together.   </p>
