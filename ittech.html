          <h1><strong>Clouds, Services and Servers (Technology 1) - By Amani Zafirah Mohammad Anwar</strong></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Q1:</p>

<p>Clouds, services, and servers are three interconnected technologies that have revolutionised the way businesses and individuals’ access and use computing resources. Clouds are essentially large networks of servers that are connected to the internet and used to store, process, and manage data remotely. This technology allows users to access and use these resources on demand, without the need to invest in and maintain their own hardware. There are three main types of clouds: public, private, and hybrid. Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party companies and are available to the public on a pay-per-use basis. Private clouds, on the other hand, are owned and operated by a single organisation and are used to store and process sensitive or proprietary data. Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds, allowing organisations to take advantage of the benefits of both.



Cloud services, also known as cloud-based services, are applications or services that are delivered over the internet from a cloud computing provider. These services can be used by individuals or businesses to access a wide range of computing resources, including storage, networking, software, analytics, and so on. Some examples of cloud services include email, document management, customer relationship management, and project management. On the other hand, servers are physical or virtual machines that are used to store, process, and manage data and resources. They are an integral part of any cloud or cloud-based service, as they provide the computing power and storage capacity needed to support these technologies.



The state of the art of this new technology is constantly evolving, with new advancements being made in areas such as cloud security, data management, and artificial intelligence. One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the emergence of edge computing, which involves processing data and running applications at the edge of the network, closer to the user or device. This allows for faster data processing and reduced latency, as data does not need to be transmitted to and from a central location. Currently, clouds, services, and servers are used in a wide range of applications, including data storage and backup, data analytics, web hosting, and software development. They are also used by organisations to scale up or down their computing resources as needed, allowing them to be more agile and responsive to changing business needs.



In the next three years, it is likely that we will see further advancements in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cloud. This will enable organizations to analyse and process large amounts of data more efficiently and accurately, leading to improved decision making and operational efficiency. We may also see the emergence of more specialized clouds, such as those focused on healthcare or finance, as well as increased adoption of hybrid clouds as organizations seek to balance the benefits of public and private clouds. The technological developments that have made these advancements possible include advances in networking and data storage technologies, as well as the proliferation of powerful and affordable computing devices. The widespread adoption of the internet and cloud technologies has also played a key role in the growth and development of these technologies.



Overall, clouds, services, and servers have had a significant impact on the way businesses and individuals’ access and use computing resources. As these technologies continue to evolve and mature, we can expect to see even more transformative applications and capabilities in the coming years.</p>

<p>Q2:</p>

<p>The impact of clouds, services, and servers on businesses and individuals has been significant and is likely to continue to be so in the future. One of the main benefits of these technologies is their ability to allow organizations to scale up or down their computing resources as needed, enabling them to be more agile and responsive to changing business needs. This has also allowed smaller organisations to access the same level of computing resources as larger ones, leveling the playing field and enabling more competition.



The potential impact of these technologies is even greater, as they enable organizations to access and analyse large amounts of data more efficiently and accurately. This can lead to improved decision making and operational efficiency, as well as the development of new products and services. In addition, the use of cloud-based services has made it easier for individuals and businesses to access a wide range of computing resources and applications without the need to invest in and maintain their own hardware. Additionally, one of the main changes that these technologies are likely to bring is the shift from on-premises computing to cloud-based computing. This will likely lead to a decrease in the need for in-house IT staff and an increase in the demand for cloud-based services. It may also lead to the development of new job roles, such as cloud engineers and data analysts.



Individuals and organizations that rely heavily on computing resources and IT infrastructure are likely to be the most affected by these developments. This includes businesses in industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail, as well as IT professionals and IT-dependent individuals. Therefore, the impact of clouds, services, and servers is likely to be significant and far-reaching. While they may create new job roles and technologies, they may also make some current ones redundant. However, the benefits they offer in terms of increased efficiency and access to computing resources are likely to outweigh any potential negative impacts. </p>

<p>Q3:</p>



<p>As an individual working in the field of IT, my daily life involves regular interaction with clouds, services, and servers. This has led to a strong emphasis on continued learning and engagement with the evolving landscape of these technologies within the IT industry. As an individual working in IT, I recognize that staying up to date with technology is an ongoing process that will likely continue throughout my career. The increasing prevalence of clouds, services, and servers may also bring about greater awareness and understanding of these technologies among my family and friends, even though they have been in use for some time. Family and friends have continued to use a cloud-based storage service to share photos and documents with their family, their loved ones will also be able to access and view these files from any location. Similarly, if an individual uses a cloud-based messaging service to communicate with their friends, their friends will also be able to access and use the service from any location. Moreover, the use of clouds, services, and servers is likely to make it easier for individuals to access and use computing resources and applications from any location. It may also make it easier for them to stay connected with their loved ones and to collaborate with team members in both personal and professional contexts. However, it is important to note that the use of these technologies also carries some potential risks and drawbacks, such as concerns about data privacy and security. As with any technology, it is important for individuals to be aware of these risks and to take steps to protect their personal information and data. </p>

        <h1 style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Natural Language Processing (Technology 2) - By Joshua Christiansen</strong></h1>
        <p>Computer science is being used to solve problems that would take an exceptionally longer amount of time to process by a human. One of these problems computer science is trying to solve is natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP from here onwards) is the study and application of making computers understand natural human language. The types of information that are being deciphered through NLP systems include computer typed writing, such as word documents and blog posts, to speech recognition software like Apple’s Siri or Google’s Voice Assistant. The goal of NLP is to be able to understand and communicate through human language as fluently as if we were speaking with another native speaker of the language being understood. This is an incredibly complicated process, the amount of sentence structures (at the very least in English) we can create are in a practical sense limitless. When it comes to understanding written or spoken words, the context can change meaning in a sentence. Two different situations where a person would say the exact same sentence could convey an entirely different meaning. To this day we are still unable to make things like chatbots that can mimic a real human, both with its ability to understand what is being said to it and then communicating back with human like intelligence. </p>



<p>When we speak or write, we can communicate through a system in which we can derive meaning. Like a list of groceries, we can look at the list of different items and understand they are things we need to purchase due to them being under the heading of groceries. However, if I were to type those individual items into a computer with the header “Grocery list” it would not grab any meaning from the words typed. It would rather take the information at face value and turn it into a user input value that is equal to itself. The first job of an NLP is to turn the user input, regardless of if it is through text or speech, into something the computer can understand. It can organize the data given into categories that give meaning to the computer, and more importantly, be used by the computer to understand what is being asked of it by the user. This is no easy feat even for humans. </p>

<p>I personally have a huge interest in sociology and world cultures. One of the most amazing and fascinating things to me is that no matter which language we choose, it cannot be translated perfectly to any other. Language itself is not a universal system of equal values like mathematics. Imagine you are in an arts class and the teacher instructs every person to create something that can teach you how to make a cake, but you cannot use numbers or letters. You can produce an idea in your head and though it is not perfect, it translates to you how you would make a cake. Try and picture what the other students would be doing, they may paint something similar but with a few differences here or there. Maybe a few will not paint but create sculptures that are a mixture of all “steps” put together in some form. It is possible to say that some of them may create artwork that does not tell you how to make a cake but gives you the feeling of what baking feels like. </p>



<p>Natural language is a lot like the art pieces in that room, everyone has a unique way of saying what could be considered the same piece of information. But they really are not the same and depending on which student you learned to communicate with, would make every other students language seem like the most bizarre thing on the planet due to the number of ways we can understand the world around us. We think the way we communicate, and that is only one perspective in an infinite world of ways to think. Now go and show your art piece to a computer and see if it can understand even 10% of the instructions you gave it. </p>



<p>NLPs now use a variety of semantic analysis processes to derive meaning and interpretations. This is a fun way of saying that for the computer to understand what is given, we are using and creating different linguistic equations that can translate what is being said. However, as linguistics is not a science, as of today it is near impossible to create a singular algorithm that can translate language accurately between humans and computers. It is unlikely that we will have a system that can do this perfectly within the next 10 years. We are using deep learning neural networks to make a mathematical communication model that will eventually lead to having enough data to mimic fluid comprehension of human linguistics. </p>



<p>This field is enormous, both in the scope of what it is doing and what it hopes to achieve. The goal is to make computers understand humans, and humans to understand computers. This can be used for things as simple as telling your phone to organize a bunch of items to be delivered to your house through speech, all the way to having a computer teach people new skills and topics through active communication. We can guess that anything that requires you to communicate with another human could be potentially replaced with a computer using NLP software. That is a crazy thought, that we could speak and be spoken to by computers that understand us as much as any other person would. A program could be taking your order from a business, giving you mental health therapy, providing comfort and companionship to people who are not getting enough interactivity with others, teach classes through open discussion and resolve disputes between others. The number of jobs being made redundant by technology is ever increasing since the industrial revolution, and I can see how jobs currently that have been mostly untouched due to being roles involving a prominent level of interpersonal communication could be replaced by AI (Artificial Intelligence) using NLP software. One of the most powerful pieces of technology humans have created is language. Humanity has flourished through communication, and when we can delegate the role of communication to computers, I am unsure if the outcome will be a boon or a hindrance to society. Personally, I see technology driving people away from interpersonal relations. I do not know if this technology will offer us a way to increase the level of human interactions that are required for a stable mental state, and that concerns me.</p>


<p>The future for NLP and its relation to myself is quite significant. NLPs have been around for decades, and we are putting them into all aspects of IT (Information Technology). I am aiming to be a software engineer, and I have no doubts that programs that will be written in the future will be using NLPs for interaction with users to a further extent than what they already are. Using NLPs to unlock a computer, using them to direct me when it comes to traffic, having them read out messages and respond accordingly and helping to give suggestions when trying to solve a problem are just a few possibilities of NLPs. For my family I can see NLPs being used to help them with organization, giving them calendar updates, advising when to take medications, giving instructions on how to use any piece of technology they have and helping them as a translator when speaking to people of another language. They are already using a few of these technologies without the help of an NLP but they can be made more user friendly and accessible to people who are not as technologically literate due to a lack of experience. Having a piece of technology that can help you the same way a person can will be an incredibly helpful tool to my family.</p>
