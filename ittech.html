          <h1><strong>Clouds, Services and Servers (Technology 1) - By Amani Zafirah Mohammad Anwar</strong></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Q1:</p>

<p>Clouds, services, and servers are three interconnected technologies that have revolutionised the way businesses and individuals’ access and use computing resources. Clouds are essentially large networks of servers that are connected to the internet and used to store, process, and manage data remotely. This technology allows users to access and use these resources on demand, without the need to invest in and maintain their own hardware. There are three main types of clouds: public, private, and hybrid (Azure, 2023). Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party companies and are available to the public on a pay-per-use basis. Private clouds, on the other hand, are owned and operated by a single organisation and are used to store and process sensitive or proprietary data. Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds, allowing organisations to take advantage of the benefits of both. 

 

Cloud services, also known as cloud-based services, are applications or services that are delivered over the internet from a cloud computing provider (Enslin, 2021). These services can be used by individuals or businesses to access a wide range of computing resources, including storage, networking, software, analytics, and so on. Some examples of cloud services include email, document management, customer relationship management, and project management. On the other hand, servers are physical or virtual machines that are used to store, process, and manage data and resources. They are an integral part of any cloud or cloud-based service, as they provide the computing power and storage capacity needed to support these technologies. 

 

The state of the art of this new technology is constantly evolving, with new advancements being made in areas such as cloud security, data management, and artificial intelligence. One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the emergence of edge computing, which involves processing data and running applications at the edge of the network, closer to the user or device. This allows for faster data processing and reduced latency, as data does not need to be transmitted to and from a central location. Currently, clouds, services, and servers are used in a wide range of applications, including data storage and backup, data analytics, web hosting, and software development. They are also used by organisations to scale up or down their computing resources as needed, allowing them to be more agile and responsive to changing business needs. 

 

In the next three years, it is likely that we will see further advancements in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cloud (Kumar et al. 2019:894). This will enable organisations to analyse and process large amounts of data more efficiently and accurately, leading to improved decision making and operational efficiency. We may also see the emergence of more specialized clouds, such as those focused on healthcare or finance, as well as increased adoption of hybrid clouds as organizations seek to balance the benefits of public and private clouds. The technological developments that have made these advancements possible include advances in networking and data storage technologies, as well as the proliferation of powerful and affordable computing devices. The widespread adoption of the internet and cloud technologies has also played a key role in the growth and development of these technologies. 

 

Overall, clouds, services, and servers have had a significant impact on the way businesses and individuals’ access and use computing resources. As these technologies continue to evolve and mature, we can expect to see even more transformative applications and capabilities in the coming years. </p>

<p>Q2:</p>

<p>The impact of clouds, services, and servers on businesses and individuals has been significant and is likely to continue to be so in the future. One of the main benefits of these technologies is their ability to allow organisations to scale up or down their computing resources as needed, enabling them to be more agile and responsive to changing business needs. This has also allowed smaller organisations to access the same level of computing resources as larger ones, leveling the playing field and enabling more competition. 

 

The potential impact of these technologies is even greater, as they enable organisations to access and analyse large amounts of data more efficiently and accurately. This can lead to improved decision making and operational efficiency, as well as the development of new products and services. In addition, the use of cloud-based services has made it easier for individuals and businesses to access a wide range of computing resources and applications without the need to invest in and maintain their own hardware. Additionally, one of the main changes that these technologies are likely to bring is the shift from on-premises computing to cloud-based computing. This will likely lead to a decrease in the need for in-house IT staff and an increase in the demand for cloud-based services. It may also lead to the development of new job roles, such as cloud engineers and data analysts. 

 

Individuals and organisations that rely heavily on computing resources and IT infrastructure are likely to be the most affected by these developments. This includes businesses in industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail, as well as IT professionals and IT-dependent individuals. Therefore, the impact of clouds, services, and servers is likely to be significant and far-reaching. While they may create new job roles and technologies, they may also make some current ones redundant. However, the benefits they offer in terms of increased efficiency and access to computing resources are likely to outweigh any potential negative impacts.  </p>

<p>Q3:</p>



<p>As an individual working in the field of IT, my daily life involves regular interaction with clouds, services, and servers. This has led to a strong emphasis on continued learning and engagement with the evolving landscape of these technologies within the IT industry. As an individual working in IT, I recognize that staying up to date with technology is an ongoing process that will likely continue throughout my career. The increasing prevalence of clouds, services, and servers may also bring about greater awareness and understanding of these technologies among my family and friends, even though they have been in use for some time. Family and friends have continued to use a cloud-based storage service to share photos and documents with their family, their loved ones will also be able to access and view these files from any location. Similarly, if an individual uses a cloud-based messaging service to communicate with their friends, their friends will also be able to access and use the service from any location. Moreover, the use of clouds, services, and servers is likely to make it easier for individuals to access and use computing resources and applications from any location. It may also make it easier for them to stay connected with their loved ones and to collaborate with team members in both personal and professional contexts. However, it is important to note that the use of these technologies also carries some potential risks and drawbacks, such as concerns about data privacy and security. As with any technology, it is important for individuals to be aware of these risks and to take steps to protect their personal information and data.  </p>

        <h1 style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Natural Language Processing (Technology 2) - By Joshua Christiansen</strong></h1>
        <p>Computer science is being used to solve problems that would take an exceptionally longer amount of time to process by a human. One of these problems computer science is trying to solve is natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP from here onwards) is the study and application of making computers understand natural human language. The types of information that are being deciphered through NLP systems include computer typed writing, such as word documents and blog posts, to speech recognition software like Apple’s Siri or Google’s Voice Assistant. The goal of NLP is to be able to understand and communicate through human language as fluently as if we were speaking with another native speaker of the language being understood. This is an incredibly complicated process, the amount of sentence structures (at the very least in English) we can create are in a practical sense limitless. When it comes to understanding written or spoken words, the context can change meaning in a sentence. Two different situations where a person would say the exact same sentence could convey an entirely different meaning. To this day we are still unable to make things like chatbots that can mimic a real human, both with its ability to understand what is being said to it and then communicating back with human like intelligence. </p>



<p>When we speak or write, we can communicate through a system in which we can derive meaning. Like a list of groceries, we can look at the list of different items and understand they are things we need to purchase due to them being under the heading of groceries. However, if I were to type those individual items into a computer with the header “Grocery list” it would not grab any meaning from the words typed. It would rather take the information at face value and turn it into a user input value that is equal to itself. The first job of an NLP is to turn the user input, regardless of if it is through text or speech, into something the computer can understand. It can organize the data given into categories that give meaning to the computer, and more importantly, be used by the computer to understand what is being asked of it by the user. This is no easy feat even for humans. </p>

<p>I personally have a huge interest in sociology and world cultures. One of the most amazing and fascinating things to me is that no matter which language we choose, it cannot be translated perfectly to any other. Language itself is not a universal system of equal values like mathematics. Imagine you are in an arts class and the teacher instructs every person to create something that can teach you how to make a cake, but you cannot use numbers or letters. You can produce an idea in your head and though it is not perfect, it translates to you how you would make a cake. Try and picture what the other students would be doing, they may paint something similar but with a few differences here or there. Maybe a few will not paint but create sculptures that are a mixture of all “steps” put together in some form. It is possible to say that some of them may create artwork that does not tell you how to make a cake but gives you the feeling of what baking feels like. </p>



<p>Natural language is a lot like the art pieces in that room, everyone has a unique way of saying what could be considered the same piece of information. But they really are not the same and depending on which student you learned to communicate with, would make every other students language seem like the most bizarre thing on the planet due to the number of ways we can understand the world around us. We think the way we communicate, and that is only one perspective in an infinite world of ways to think. Now go and show your art piece to a computer and see if it can understand even 10% of the instructions you gave it. </p>



<p>NLPs now use a variety of semantic analysis processes to derive meaning and interpretations. This is a fun way of saying that for the computer to understand what is given, we are using and creating different linguistic equations that can translate what is being said. However, as linguistics is not a science, as of today it is near impossible to create a singular algorithm that can translate language accurately between humans and computers. It is unlikely that we will have a system that can do this perfectly within the next 10 years. We are using deep learning neural networks to make a mathematical communication model that will eventually lead to having enough data to mimic fluid comprehension of human linguistics. </p>



<p>This field is enormous, both in the scope of what it is doing and what it hopes to achieve. The goal is to make computers understand humans, and humans to understand computers. This can be used for things as simple as telling your phone to organize a bunch of items to be delivered to your house through speech, all the way to having a computer teach people new skills and topics through active communication. We can guess that anything that requires you to communicate with another human could be potentially replaced with a computer using NLP software. That is a crazy thought, that we could speak and be spoken to by computers that understand us as much as any other person would. A program could be taking your order from a business, giving you mental health therapy, providing comfort and companionship to people who are not getting enough interactivity with others, teach classes through open discussion and resolve disputes between others. The number of jobs being made redundant by technology is ever increasing since the industrial revolution, and I can see how jobs currently that have been mostly untouched due to being roles involving a prominent level of interpersonal communication could be replaced by AI (Artificial Intelligence) using NLP software. One of the most powerful pieces of technology humans have created is language. Humanity has flourished through communication, and when we can delegate the role of communication to computers, I am unsure if the outcome will be a boon or a hindrance to society. Personally, I see technology driving people away from interpersonal relations. I do not know if this technology will offer us a way to increase the level of human interactions that are required for a stable mental state, and that concerns me.</p>


<p>The future for NLP and its relation to myself is quite significant. NLPs have been around for decades, and we are putting them into all aspects of IT (Information Technology). I am aiming to be a software engineer, and I have no doubts that programs that will be written in the future will be using NLPs for interaction with users to a further extent than what they already are. Using NLPs to unlock a computer, using them to direct me when it comes to traffic, having them read out messages and respond accordingly and helping to give suggestions when trying to solve a problem are just a few possibilities of NLPs. For my family I can see NLPs being used to help them with organization, giving them calendar updates, advising when to take medications, giving instructions on how to use any piece of technology they have and helping them as a translator when speaking to people of another language. They are already using a few of these technologies without the help of an NLP but they can be made more user friendly and accessible to people who are not as technologically literate due to a lack of experience. Having a piece of technology that can help you the same way a person can will be an incredibly helpful tool to my family.</p>

          <h1><strong>Cyber Security (Technology 3) - By Khaled Elmasri</strong></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Cyber security is the sole intent of protecting systems, networks, programs or anything similar and has been around since 1972 which started with a project related to ARPANET which was a precursor to the internet. The state of the art for cyber security for this time currently would be the certification ISO 27001. ISO/IEC 27000 series as the name implies is a part of a set of standards developed to help with information security. The full name of the ISO 27001 is “ISO/IEC 27001 – Information security, cyber security and privacy protection – information security management systems – requirements”. This certification is a standard that utilizes an Information and Security management System while also allowing businesses of any size to manage and store their information safely in a cost effective and in a systematic way. ISO 27001 was published by the joint technical committee of “International Organization for Standardization (ISO)” and “International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)”. Both organisations develop, manage and update similar international standards</p>
		  <p>This standard allows businesses and companies with the necessary knowledge to protect their information; however there are businesses that get certified against ISO 27001; the business may do it for the reputation of best practice or to reassure customers and clients. This means that customers and anyone else involved can trust the business to protect any of the data confided in them because they follow set standards. These standards must be kept and assessed regularly if ISO is to continue supplying the business with the certification however being certified by ISO 27001 means that a person has attended and completed a course setup by ISO and IEC that proves their skill in regard to changing and/or fixing an Information Security Management System for potential customers and or employers. One of the many upsides of ISO 27001 is that it “is easily recognised all around the world, increasing business opportunities for organizations and professionals” (Kosutic, Dejan (No date))[1]. Every standard related to ISO and IEC have principles that outline what is the basic goal of said standard.</p>

		  <p><b>Iso's principles are:</b></p>
		  <p>-	Confidentiality meaning only the people related to the data may access the information.</p>
		  <p>-	Integrity is that only authorized people may change the information.</p>
		  <p>-	Availability to authorized personnel whenever needed. </p>

		  <p>The basic framework of ISO 27001 is reliant on the processes of managing risks. This implies that the people under ISO 27001 will assess possible risks and incidents that could happen and attempt to find a solution that needs to be implemented to help prevent any of those proceeding risks or incidents from occurring. ISO 27001 has implemented “controls”, which are referred to as safeguards. These safeguards are “practices to be implemented to reduce risks to acceptable levels” (ISO/IEC 27001 and related standards – information security management, 2022) [3], these safeguards are (but not limited to) technological, organizational, physical and human-related.  </p>
		  <p>With ISO 27001 businesses in varying size can secure their information in all forms and being cost effective. Meaning that paper, cloud and digital based data is safe and secure. This also increases the businesses resilience to cyber-attacks. In utilizing the ISO 27001 standard the business is provided a system that manages all of its information all in one place while also ensuring a definitive way to defend it from technological-based attacks or other threats which also directly translates into having the ability to defend itself from threats that are continually evolving in cyber security. In the near future it is very possible that there will be less technologically based attacks as the ISO and IEC unity will continue to improve upon its standards which will improve the safety and procedures conducted in the next five years. It would also be correct to assume that the tests to become certified or certified against will improve. There isn’t really any technological advancement that impacts these changes; it’s more or less the people behind ISO and IEC that make these changes possible as it is a standard that people study and follow. Thus making businesses and individuals more secure with their data.</p>
		  <p>As a result of the increase in security of the business it will make for a safer and more successful change for businesses that require the user to confide their data in a business such as websites, banks, companies etc. For e.g. a business or individual that has procured a certification for or against will have a safer and reliable customer base as most customers will have known about the ISO 27001 standards allowing for a more profitable business in the long run. It will also be true for the opposite, being that people who do not have these certifications will not be as successful since the customers will have a harder time trusting the business in protecting their data. This will also lower the chances in which a business is attacked by hackers or outsider threats because of a business’s decision to either get their employees tested or get certified against by ISO and IEC as it would give the employees vital knowledge which would increase the overall resilience to cyber attacks due to taking the test. On the other side of the spectrum, the smaller businesses that can’t afford it and don’t have the verification would experience a harder time surviving attacks since most of the cyber attacks would funnel onto them as their defence is weaker when compared to those who do have the certification. This would affect the cyber security professionals that test the resilience of businesses as most employees or the business will have knowledge and the necessary controls (safeguards) to check for their own systems for risks and issues. The cyber security professionals would have received fewer commissions to be able to do their job, which would eventually make their jobs redundant as a result of the certification. A few recently created technologies would be used more often, such as the use of advanced threat detection, advanced endpoint protection and artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
		  <p>The effects of ISO 27001 will affect my daily life greatly as I do and many people in this time store most if not everything online. As discussed in the previous paragraph, many weaker systems will be targeted by hackers and cyber attacks since most of the high profile businesses will have the option to invest in acquiring a certification. This would most definitely mean that my systems have a higher likely hood of being attacked if I do not attempt to learn more about my systems or attempt to increase my systems resilience against risks or threats as all my data is online. However any data that is outside my systems or in businesses would mean that I can have more trust in them if they have acquired certification, allowing me to feel more assured in saving my passwords onto websites or providing my data to businesses or paying for something online as I know that there will be more resilience to risks or threats. As a result of these changes my family, friends and I would all try to learn more about the ISO series and take the exam/test while also keeping a watch out for businesses that do not have the qualification. Indicating or pressuring us away from said business. For e.g. If a gaming company or a investing company were to not have the qualifications that prove to us that they are trustworthy in safeguarding our data such as our personal emails, card information or postcode etc. We would not be investing or paying for anything in regards to those businesses/corporations. Thus, businesses that can afford to would greatly benefit from the ISO 27000 series. Individuals and I may also learn a lot about cyber attacks and how to protect their data with ISO 27000 but ultimately depends on if the individual wants to and if they have enough finances to acquire it.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #ffffff;"><strong> Machine Learning (Technology 4) - By Victor Williams</strong></h1>
        <p>Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that allows a program to learn through four
major ways and be able to predict outcomes without being told to.
The 4 major ways are Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Semi-Supervised
learning and Reinforced learning.
Supervised learning is done in a controlled environment by using labelled datasets to train it
to be able to predict the outcome accurately. As more data is fd through the machine will
be able to organise it into its relevant position for example being able to differentiate spam
from normal email.
This is done by organising and comparing the data to its relevant types and being able to
store them in such a way.
For example if you were to draw a graph with likes and dislikes of someones movies. The
machine would be able to use the genre of those movies to accurately predict if the person
would like or not like a new movie.
Unsupervised learning is done in an uncontrolled manner by giving a bunch of data to a
program and relying on it to sort it by its similarity or difference. This is called Clustering. It is
used to
produce unclassed data represented by patterns and structures. This is used by news sites
to store and organise articles relevant to the same or similar events.
Semi-Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses both of the previously
mentioned. Small sets of predetermined data are used and far more of unsorted data to
quickly train the AI to be able to sort the set data into a relevant position.
It is useful when you have a high amount of data. Semi-Supervised is used in medical
imaging. By providing the machine with a set of predetermined data it can quickly learn and
organise the unorganised data.
Reinforced machine learning is like supervised learning except it uses the trial and error
method to organise data. The more successful outcomes the more the program is reinforced
the better it does.
The state of machine learning I'd say is the Google Cloud Learning Machine (GCLM). GCLM
is a form of algorithm that learns from past data through analysis and pattern matching. This
allows it to store and quickly access the data without needing to runthrough the calculations
again.
It has an incredible amount of uses. Businesses can use it to predict customer buying habits
and thus show relevant ads in order to sell more. As well as predicting market trends,
popular products and more.
As to what can be done now is really just feeding more information and learning the
outcomes.
As machine learning is worked on and developed it becomes more and more ingrained in
our society more and more places use it for our good or bad.
Technological developments that make machine learning possible are faster and better
computers and processors.
The potential impact of machine learning is the question of whether we know if our actions
are our own or not.
For example the ads we see on websites. As machine learning gets better it is able to
advertise to us individually on a personal level.
While we want a product but have not considered buying it, through persistent advertisement
the AI may be able to crack us and we buy it. Or say a place uses to hire people. The ai
lacks the human touch and mainly makes it choice based on the data present
Thus while a candidate may not be found suitable a further sitdown talk may prove that the
candidate is rather well suited for the position.
The most likely thing to change about machine learning is the complexity and the speed of
the outcomes as most big AI stores the information that is put into them thus making it easier
and quicker to be able to come up with an outcome.
Really everyone is most affected by machine learning as it has too many uses from
shopping to hiring people to more complex uses in medicine.
As at the end of the day it is a machine/ program it does lack the touch and critical thinking
of a human however roles such as data analysis could be under pressure as it improves and
evolves we might find ourselves being reliant in machine learning to organise complex data
structures.
This will and has affected me in terms of advertisements. I may look something up and I am
bombarded with brands and deals. While it may be good I find it annoying and not very
trustworthy.
In terms of medical machine learning, for me it would be good for diagnosis and such as
machine learning mainly improves and is able to give out an accurate result. However at the
same time it is also bad as
There are alot of places that would gladly buy data and are related to people and use it
against me.
As for my friends and family it would affect data breaches may be used against them or use
of medical history. As this information can be fed into a machine learning algorithm and that
is a breach of trust and highly illegal.</p>
