          <p>As visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery. Here are some things that visual learners like to do to learn better:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sit near the front of the classroom.</li>
          <li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
          <li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
          <li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>
          <li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</li>
          <li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
          <li>Colour code things.</li>
          <li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li></p>
